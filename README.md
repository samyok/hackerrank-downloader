# What is this??


When I'm grading the Hackerrank portions of Science Olympiad Cybersecurity exams, as it's really annoying to time-check each submission and make 
sure that the students submitted before their time is up. 

This just attaches to a chrome instance and then creates two CSV files. I'm uploading to Github for future reference :)
